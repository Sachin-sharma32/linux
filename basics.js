// SUB: Features of OS

// Detecting and preparing hardware
// Manage Process -> where and how much CPU of allocate to each program
// Managing RAM

// Filesystem 
// Linux is based on UNIX

// SUB: Advanced Features

// Clustering -> combining multiple systems into one
// Virtualization 
// Cloud Computing
// Real Time Computing -> prioritising processes

// SUB: Propritary OS

// windows and Mac 
// cannot and see and change code of OS
// cannot plug your own software into OS

// SUB: History of linux 

// UNIX was owned by AT&t, initially they kept it open sourced
// C was created as a high level language to make programs for UNIX
// AT&T split up and were not allowed to sell software 
// So they licenced it to universities, but this version lacked build in compiler
// University of California created a similar UNIX OS and was open sourced called Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD)
// AT&T's version became more restrictive
// At&T's UNIX falied because of stiff compition from already established Windows
// different companies started their own linux distrubutions from BSD which were private 
// GNU was the first development which started a "Free Software Foundation"
// free software word was replaced by "open source"
// GNU was better than original UNIX because of being open sourced
// GPL (GNU Public Lience) was obtained to keep GNU open sourced
// But GNU failed to produce a kernel 
// BSD falied because of law-suits from AT&T 
// MacOS is build on BSD 
// Linus Torvelds started Linux development as a kernel for GNU 
// Linux Foundation was estabilished to protech Linux legally and set standards
// With KDE and GNOME, linux became available for desktop 
// Open Source Initiative (OSI) issue licences to software it accespt -> GPL, Mozilla, MIT, BSD licences as well 

// SUB: Linux Distros emergence

// to bring linux to normal users
// Linux kernel + softwares + UI + GUI -> distribution 
// Red Hat Linux and Debian laid foundation for other distributions 
// Red Hat was equired by IBM and Red Hat Linux was abandoned and Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora were formed
// RHEL -> enterprise level
// Fedora -> normal users
// CentOS and Oracle Linux are build using source code of RHEL
// Fedora focus on latest tech but lacks stability
// Most RHEL software are first tested on Fedora 
// along side RHEL and Fedora, Debian was also formed 
// Debian is also highly stable
// >130 distros are based on Debian -> Linux Mint, Elementary OS, Ubuntu, Kali

// SUB: How Linux companies make money 

// subscription 
// Certifications
// Bounty
// Donations 

// SUB: Certifications 

// Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA) -> intermediate
// Red Hat Certified Engineer (RHCE) -> Advanced
// To get RHCE, pass RHCSA and RHCE 
// LATER: RHCE and RHCSA Topics 


// TOPIC: CHAPER 2: Linux Desktop   

// SUB: Desktop envirnoments

// most linux distros uses GNOME as linux destop envornment (to be used by normal people)  
// older linux distro and system special linux servers don't have a desktop environment 
// X Windows manager -> oldest linux desktop environment 
// before terminal was used for everything 
// X controlled hardware and window manager manged the window and applications 
// GNOME and KDE -> powerful desktop environments 
// LXDE and Xfce -> lightweight desktop environments 
// can install different desktop environments and switch between them 
// GNOME -> post popular and stable 
// KDE -> more application, less stable then GNOME 
// LXDE -> lighweight, fast and energy efficient

// SUB: GNOME

// files -> other location -> connect to server (enter ip address of machine)
